# leetcode-problems
This is a list of all the leet code problems that I solved with the goal of improving my problem solving and coding skills over time.
My aim is to solve 1 to 3 leet code problems per day and come up with my own solutions regardless if they are initially not the most optimal. After solving them, I then take a look at the solutions other people have provided to learn on making my future solutions better.
